# Data-Scraping-using-BeautifulSoup-and-Python
In this project, I scraped IMDB Top 250 movie data, including movie_name, and year of release, and saved that scraped data into an Excel '.xlsx' file

In this project, I used Python, and BeautifulSoup for Scraping the data.

You must install Selenium, BeautifulSoup(bs4) and some Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
